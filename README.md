# Students dropout and academic success
This is my first project exactly to study ML. Dataset from UCI (https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)
This paper is not accomplished up to the end (current stage is EDA). I want all parts of the project will be strong prepared and proved. Additionaly, I consider build an algorithm which is more effective.
Points of this project:
1) descriptive statistics
2) scetter plots and histograms (also density with)
3) parallel coordinates and a lot of bars
4) correlations

### Next step is math stat cheking for some interesting features.
